\small As an aspiring organizational psychologist, I have a unique blend of academic and diverse life experiences that would benefit almost any mission. After two rewarding decades of raising my four children, I am returning to the workforce, seeking meaningful work in public service that allows me to help others achieve their goals. In addition to fulfilling and broad undergraduate studies in informatics, computer science, data, and systems - among others - and graduate work in psychology, I have a solid foundation of experiences demonstrating my passion for growth. From my volunteer work to living abroad in Germany or my work in photography, helping people show their best at the most important moments in their lives - I have cultivated a deep appreciation for other cultures and perspectives and have a profound sense of enthusiasm to re-enter the workforce and contribute toward meaningful work.}
